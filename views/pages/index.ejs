      <h1 class="w3-center">About Recipe Vision</h1><br>
      <h5 class="w3-center">A Passion for Food & Cooking</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">We were inspired to create this as part of a project for our Software Engineering class. It is brought to you by Brian, Ryan, Monique, & Kristine. Among our many brilliant ideas, we felt strongest about this one. <b>Who doesn't love food?!</b> We were motivated by our passion for food, and know that many users would also enjoy this idea. The way they will get to search for recipes through the use of text and images,it is different from other websites. We want the users to feel just as excited about food and cooking as we are.</p>
     </br>
     
      <h5 class="w3-center">Overall Goals</h5>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">The goal was to deliver an application that could search for recipes using manually typed searches as well as pictures of food. The web application can allow users to use their own photos of food to find recipes for that particular dish. Users will be able to find real, trusted recipes that are pulled from a Recipe Search API called <a href="https://developer.edamam.com/">Edamam</a>. Once users have found recipes that they desire, they can choose to save the recipes in what we call a `recipe book`. Later on we plan to have users share recipes and chat to other users based on what they saved. </p>

      <h1 class="w3-center">How It Works</h1>
      
      <p>We are able to make our project work through quite a few approaches and technologies. The framework we used was Node.js & Express. The IDE we used was Cloud9. The main API's we used are Edamam API, & Google Vision API. Finally, we deployed the website on Heroku.</p>
     </br>
      <h4>Heroku</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">We are using Heroku in order to host our application.</p>
        
      <h4>Edamam API</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">With this API, it provides a vast amount of recipes including pictures, calories and source links.</p>
      
      <h4>Youtube API</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Allows us to pull recipe videos relevent to the searches</p>

      <h4>Google Vision API</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Through this API, it grabs the contents of an image, which allows for the recipe search.</p><br>
